# NFL TEAM DATA SCRAPER

Exactly like it sounds. Old data is currently included in the `/team-data` folder.
To get newer, potentially updated data:
- Clone this git repository.
- Run the `npm install` command to download all necessary node modules.
- Run `node index.js` and the scraper will begin pulling data from the nfl.com website
- One json file per team will be outputted in a `/team-data-${yourCurrentDate}` folder
